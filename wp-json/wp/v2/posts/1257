However, there&#8217;s a some\u00a0mistakes that many WordPress users make and that can be exploited by potential attackers. In this article, I&#8217;m presenting you simple steps for maximum security.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<h2>Stay updated<\/h2>\n<p>As a rule of thumb, every time the WordPress core or a plugin you\u2019re using has an available update, don&#8217;t forget to apply it. Updates bring new features, but also security fixes. Although WordPress has automatic background updates since version 3.7, you should always keep an eye on them, as automatic updates may sometimes fail to complete.<\/p>\n<p>Plugins are also a sensitive part of your WordPress installation. Remember\u00a0to update them as soon as an update is available.<\/p>\n<h2>Pick a random user name<\/h2>\n<p>Attackers know that most people are using usernames such as \u201cadmin\u201d or the url of their website. By picking a random user name, you\u2019re making their task much more difficult.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Always pick a strong password<\/h2>\n<p>It might seem like a obvious\u00a0tip, but working with WordPress (and websites in general) every day, I can tell you that most people tend to use \u00a0weak passwords to protect something as important as their own website.<\/p>\n<p>A strong password has:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>at least 15 characters<\/li>\n<li>uppercase letters<\/li>\n<li>lowercase letters<\/li>\n<li>numbers<\/li>\n<li>symbols, such as <code>` ! \" ? $ ? % ^ &amp; * ( ) _ - + = { [ } ] :<\/code><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A strong password is not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>your login or username<\/li>\n<li>your name, your friend\u2019s name, your family member\u2019s name, or a common name<\/li>\n<li>a dictionary word<\/li>\n<li>like your previous passwords<\/li>\n<li>your date of birth<\/li>\n<li>a keyboard pattern, such as qwerty, asdfghjkl, or 12345678<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Need help to pick a super strong password? Head over this <a href=\"https:\/\/strongpasswordgenerator.com\/\" target=\"blank\">simple but efficient web app<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<h2>Host your website on a reliable web host<\/h2>\n<p>Especially if you\u2019re on a shared server (this is the case of most small websites such as a personal blog), attackers can use corrupted files on the server, even if they aren\u2019t yours, to spread on other websites hosted on the server. This can\u2019t be fully stopped by you alone, this is why you need to be sure that your web host is super serious about security and offers a strong customer support that will always be helpful in case of any problems.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Make regular\u00a0backups<\/h2>\n<p>If a problem happens, it is essential for every developer to have a backup of both your database and files, so you can restore it to your server. Backups can be done manually or using a plugin such as <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-database-backup\/\" target=\"blank\">WP Database Backup<\/a>. Your web host can also make regular back-ups of your website and database.<\/p>\n<h2>Use .htaccess to protect wp-login<\/h2>\n<p>Password protecting your <code>wp-login.php<\/code> file can add an extra layer to your server. Because password protecting wp-admin can break any plugin that uses ajax on the front end, it\u2019s usually sufficient to just protect <code>wp-login.php<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>To do this, you will need to create a <code>.htpasswd<\/code> file. To do so, go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.htaccesstools.com\/htpasswd-generator\/\" target=\"blank\">htpasswd generator<\/a> and follow the instructions. Once you have your file ready, upload it to your server.<\/p>\n<p>Once done, you need to tell <code>.htaccess<\/code> where it\u2019s at. Assuming you\u2019ve put <code>.htpasswd<\/code> in your user\u2019s home directory and your htpasswd username is mysecretuser, then you put this in your <code>.htaccess<\/code> file:<\/p>\n<pre># Stop Apache from serving .ht* files\r\n&lt;Files ~ \"^\\.ht\"&gt;\r\nOrder allow,deny\r\nDeny from all\r\n&lt;\/Files&gt;\r\n\r\n# Protect wp-login\r\n&lt;Files wp-login.php&gt;\r\nAuthUserFile ~\/.htpasswd\r\nAuthName \"Private access\"\r\nAuthType Basic\r\nrequire user mysecretuser\r\n&lt;\/Files&gt;\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a plugin instead of doing it by yourself, have a look at <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/askapache-password-protect\/\" target=\"blank\">AskApache Password Protect<\/a>. Please note though, that it hasn\u2019t been updated in a year. I haven\u2019t tried it myself so I can\u2019t really neither recommend nor not recommend this plugin.<\/p>\n<h2>Remove unnecessary error messages<\/h2>\n<p>Login error messages are useful, but unfortunately, they can also provide information to attackers.<\/p>\n<p>To get rid of login errors display on your <code>wp-login.php<\/code> page, open your <code>functions.php<\/code> file and append the code below to it:<\/p>\n<pre>add_filter('login_errors',create_function('$a', \"return null;\"));<\/pre>\n<h2>Be careful with plugins and themes<\/h2>\n<p>Basically, everything a developer adds to your WordPress install (Themes and Plugins) potentially contains vulnerable code. In fact, anyone can write and offer a plugin or <a href=\"http:\/\/catswhocode.com\/go\/themeforest.html\" target=\"blank\">theme<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When choosing a plugin or a theme, make sure that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You get it from a reliable source, such as the official WordPress.org repositories<\/li>\n<li>The plugin\/theme is well maintained and has been updated recently<\/li>\n<li>The plugin has a significant number of installs and\/or ratings<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Premium themes and plugins that you can find available for free might often contain malicious code injected in them. Sure, a premium theme or a plugin is an investment, but the average $60 you\u2019ll spend is a lot cheaper than the help of a developer or security expert to help you with a broken or a hijacked website. Established premium theme\/plugin sellers as such as <a href=\"http:\/\/catswhocode.com\/go\/elegantthemes.html\" target=\"blank\">ElegantThemes<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/catswhocode.com\/go\/themeforest.html\" target=\"blank\">ThemeForest<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/catswhocode.com\/go\/themify.html\" target=\"blank\">Themify<\/a> are very serious about security.<\/p>\n<h2>Rename your database tables<\/h2>\n<p>By default, WordPress uses <code>wp_<\/code> to prefix your database tables. While it can be easily changed when installing WordPress, unfortunately most developers\u00a0don\u2019t modify the default prefix. It makes it easier for attackers to target your database.<\/p>\n<p>Happily, there\u2019s a handy plugin called <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/db-prefix-change\/\" target=\"blank\">DB Prefix Change<\/a> which allows you to easily change your database prefix from the default <code>wp_<\/code> to something unique and virtually impossible to guess.<\/p>\n<h2>Disable file editing<\/h2>\n<p>WordPress features a built-in file editor, which can be very useful to edit your theme on the fly. Unfortunately, if an attacker gains access to your WordPress dashboard as an administrator, he will be able to edit your files, and do much damage. For this reason, you might want to disable WordPress built-in file editor and use a regular FTP program to edit your theme files instead.<\/p>\n<p>To do so, simply paste the code below into your <code>wp-config.php<\/code> file, which is located at the root of your WordPress install.<\/p>\n<pre>define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true);<\/pre>\n<h2>Make use of the All In One WP Security &amp; Firewall plugin<\/h2>\n<p>The All In One WordPress Security plugin will take your website security to a whole new level. Designed and written by expert developers, it reduces security risk by checking for vulnerabilities, and by implementing and enforcing the latest recommended WordPress security practices and techniques.<\/p>\n<p>Install All In One WP Security from your WordPress dashboard or download it from <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/all-in-one-wp-security-and-firewall\/\" target=\"blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>WordPress itself is a very secure platform.
