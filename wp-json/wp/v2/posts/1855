When interpreting the term literally in relation to IT, we could conclude it\u2019s a programmer for websites. It is definitely an IT specialist, which means a programmer, but there is no way to define it precisely, it\u2019s a very general term, and it can only be given a detailed meaning when we specify the scope of tasks or technologies. They are <strong>responsible for web applications \u2014 mainly for creating them.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A <strong>web developer<\/strong> has plenty of career paths, sets of skills and possibilities. In most cases, it\u2019s a front-end type programmer who is responsible for the website visible to the end user, its mechanics, the web app. But there are also IT specialists working at the so-called back-end as well as DevOps that are referred to as web developers. Unlike a web architect, a web developer doesn\u2019t specialize in graphics or aesthetics of WWW on the designing side. Neither is its content itself within the scope of tasks of a front-end developer, the content is taken care of by the client, a copywriter or the person in charge of SEO.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the responsibilities of a web developer?<\/h2>\n<p>The core of a web developer\u2019s responsibilities is creating the source code of a web app. A web dev often watches over the entirety of a project, taking the role of a technical consultant, analyst and solution architect.<\/p>\n<h2>Who is sought after as a web developer? What type of soft and hard skills are required?<\/h2>\n<p>Before starting your first job, you need to master coding in HTML, CSS and JS. These three languages are currently the basis of website coding. Due to the changing needs of clients, it\u2019s a good idea to learn one of the programming languages (like PHP).<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for a web dev to be immune to stress and be able to work under time pressure. In this position, the ability to look at the problems at hand in a creative and analytical way is a must. Interpersonal skills are also important. Especially if you want to be part of a team.<\/p>\n<h2>What is responsive design?<\/h2>\n<p>Basically it is to develop websites that suit different devices like cell phones, tablets and desktop.Thinking about responsive design is inherent in building websites. Currently building websites is synonymous with performing responsive design.<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s the difference between a web developer and WordPress developer?<\/h2>\n<p>That depends on how you look at it. In case of a limited budget on the part of the person ordering a website, which happens pretty often on the Polish job market, the role of a person who makes WordPress based websites is in most cases limited to installing WordPress, implementing a ready-made theme and installing a few basic plugins that allow for better content management.<\/p>\n<p>For more experienced programmers, on the other hand, WordPress is merely a \u201cframework\u201d that can be used to create all kinds of wonders, which sometimes requires very good knowledge of PHP and JS (on top of HTML and CSS, obviously).<\/p>\n<h2>What are the biggest drawbacks\/downsides and upsides of such work?<\/h2>\n<p>Working in such a position is very demanding, which is why it may quickly lead to professional burnout. The biggest downside is struggling to meet the deadlines. The frustration, which is often related to insufficiently stated requirements, leads to permanent stress. The constant changes in the IT industry as well as new solutions require constant learning.<\/p>\n<p>The greatest advantage is the salary and the ability to influence millions of users with the software created.<\/p>\n<h2>What soft and hard skills are needed to become a web developer?<\/h2>\n<p>The hard skills are a must if you want to work in this position. These include, among others, knowledge of different programming languages, frameworks, tools required to create, expand and test software, as well as knowledge of the English language \u2013 at least to a degree that allows to freely read and understand technical documentation.<\/p>\n<p>Employers are also putting a growing emphasis on soft skills \u2013 as those impact whether a particular individual has the ability to work in a group, or predispositions to be a link in the company.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why a very important thing is communication with others, which has a direct impact on the atmosphere within the team. The ability to ask the right questions and to analyze what in many cases is not very specialized information from the client, as well as translate it to a programming language, is another appreciated skill that has an impact on more than just the work organization.<\/p>\n<p>This means that the best candidates for this position will be those who already possess technical knowledge combined with adequate soft skills.<\/p>\n<p><strong><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\"\r\n     style=\"display:block; text-align:center;\"\r\n     data-ad-layout=\"in-article\"\r\n     data-ad-format=\"fluid\"\r\n     data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-7829400583245190\"\r\n     data-ad-slot=\"7226953054\"><\/ins>\r\n<script>\r\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n<\/script><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s the difference between Front-end and Back-end professionals?<\/h2>\n<p>Front-end developer is responsible for designing the interfaces of a website, working with the part of the application that interacts with the user. This professional deals with the languages ??on the \u201cfront\u201d as HTML, CSS and Javascript.<\/p>\n<h2>What do you find most interesting in the web developer\u2019s job?<\/h2>\n<p>Working in this position allows you to carry out very diverse types of projects, both small websites that will be visited by a small number of people as well as large applications that will be used by thousands of people from all around the world every day.<\/p>\n<p>The constant development of web technologies, as well as frequently appearing new tools, streamline the work, not allowing for stagnation. Programming languages have no nationalities or borders, which makes them universal and understandable to developers all over the world.<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s the difference between a web designer and web developer?<\/h2>\n<p>The web designer works with website design, but caring about issues that aim for ease of use that user experiences. Whereas on the other hand, a web developer deals with the code part of the interfaces.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the greatest difficulties\/downsides and upsides of this job?<\/h2>\n<p>What makes this job interesting is at the same time its greatest advantage. What might be an upside to some will be a downside to others, which is why everyone who is forward-thinking about programming should find out for themselves and develop their opinion on the topic. It\u2019s the kind of job that should arise from passion \u2013 if it\u2019s not something we enjoy then, just like any other, it won\u2019t give us the sense of accomplishment, satisfaction and fulfillment.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the difference between website and webpage?<\/h2>\n<p>The difference between a website and a web page is that a website consists of a number of web pages, whilst a web page is, as its name suggests, just one page. In essence, a web page is akin to the page of a book, it being a small part of a website, just as a page is of a book.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is a web developer?
